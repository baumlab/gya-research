I am very much an advocate for basic, fundamental research, and try my best to evaluate the proposals on their merit of discovery, without a particular use inspiration in mind.  However, the NSERC grant application guidelines still ask for a statement of impact and invariably people write about the economic or industrial impacts.  I think NSERC should be required to reword this portion of the DG program to make it absolutely clear that the impact is itself not an economic or industrial impact, but a discovery impact, or remove the requirement for this next to useless section of the proposal.  Why?  Because even in the Discovery grant system, proposals that are ""innovative"" with strong economic potential do get more highly evaluated, and then scientists are betting on winners and losers instead of only evaluating the quality of the science.

How this funding will generate fundamental research without any support for research activities?    Secondly, the mandatory requirement of Canadian industry partner is also harming quite a lot while obtaining funding for Fundamental research. Traditionally (with my little experience) I realised Canadian industry does not have appreciation towards the fundamental research. In this scenario if an early career researcher like me involves any international company to support fundamental research the researcher is penalised by charging overhead on the funding given by this industry. Unfortunately, this scenario not only makes researcher feel discouraged and unfair but also the company feels - who are willing to come to Canada and bringing their world class technology to Canadian researchers -  that they are unwelcome to Canada.  It is confusing to me how this is not eligible since the money is coming to Canada, funding is generating salaries for HQPs or even in this case one job position in Canada but still NSERC doesn't recognise this partnership as an eligible partnership.

For me responding to this survey has been frustrating because I think it missed the MAJOR shift in research funding that happened Canada-wide in the 1990s.  The per capita decrease in support for fundamental research, especially through the Federal grant councils has been most disheartening. We have all been pushed into currying favours from industry, accepting significant personal risks when taking on graduate students and pursuing things that hold little interest for us.  I would NOT pursue an academic career today if I could start again, and I can tell you that the best Canadian students are leaving the research path in droves. There is nothing noble or desirable about being a 'research whore' or about accepting (often stupid and uniformed) research direction from those with very little understanding of research or from failed academics who could not win or hold down a research appointment themselves. The system is seriously broken and it is going to cost Canadians significantly in the long run. I doubt we will be collectively smart enough to understand that it could have been better.","Natural Science","1979","Canada","Male","Most of what I have to say has been said above. I might further qualify this by saying that I have had an above average career with >200 publications, c. 50 graduate students, and for the past 18 years annual grant portfolios of at least $1M.  It was fun in the 80s still reasonable as work through the 90s but increasingly stark since the millennium with hugely hard work, often requiring 80h/week ... way too much of it spent with fighting the bureaucracy (often over accountability issues spread over the past decade like a smother blanket over all researchers), and in grant applications and useless reports.  Before 1995 virtually ALL of my best students went on to effective and successful careers in research (many award winners in my cohort of graduate students).  Since the mid-90s NONE of the best Canadian students have entered the research arena and several have told me that this is because they did not want to have to work as hard as I did.  I have had some very good graduate students since then, but almost all of them have come from offshore, or did their undergraduate programs elsewhere in Canada where they were not exposed to the sort of work that is required to succeed in this lousy environment, stuck in a rut of being able to do very little of what one finds very exciting in my areas: systematics, ecology and evolutionary biology.",""

To get these grants there must be companies or government agencies signed on, which seems like the government wanting to see partnerships as a 'legitimising' litmus test for grant applications. NSERC also offers curiosity based ""Discovery Grants"" but these are rather small awards. Genome Canada is another funding agency that is skewed heavily towards applied research. Many canadian funding sources demand that ""matching funding"" is in place - this seems like a mechanism whereby agencies don't have the budget (or, I'd say, don't have the courage) to fund a full project.

In Canada, in my impression, except NSERC Discovery (very small fund; in Japan, this scale fund is for very early stage young researchers. Professors and associate professors in the top ranked universities do not apply to such small scale fund.), we need to find the fund partner in industry, NPO or others.

In addition, the inability and unwillingness of the scientific community to justify their research is not helping. Again, making a distinction between pure and applied science is futile. We need to look at the quality of research and support areas of strength -- i.e., we need to make choices rather than spreading stuff around. This also means that we need to communicate better how our research benefits society. While I understand that that is easier said than done in certain research areas it is our ultimate responsibility to do so or to at least make an attempt. To just negate that responsibility under the pretence  of pure research is ill conceived and frankly disrespectful to researchers who are pushing the envelope on research that happen to have an application. This leads to a downward spiral in a funding climate (ad societal climate) in which the community should embrace their responsibility to justify their research funding in the context of good science and some down the road perhaps remote but arguable ""application"".  Phrased differently (the website forced me to rewrite)  Making a distinction between pure and applied research is futile. We as a community have a responsibility to explain why what we do is important. While In understand it is easier for certain research areas than others to justify funding, complete refusal to commit to this responsibility under the pretense of ""pure"" research is not only disrespectful to researchers that are making this effort it also sends a wrong message to society as a whole. If we can not meet the bar of relating our work to some ""application"" however remote, we do not have the right to ask society to support us. Having said this research does of course need to meet a high standard excluding exercises in commercialization by ""researchers"" that do not even know what it takes to carry out a research program of international standard.","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1997","Canada","Male","While I appreciate your efforts to bring issues related to research funding to society's attention, I am afraid the effort is futile if one continues to insist on making a distinction between ""pure"" and ""applied"" research. There are numerous examples where an ""applied"" question leads to lots of great ""pure"" research and it strikes me as dogmatic to insist on this old turf war separation between ""pure"" and ""applied"" research. Instead, we should have a discussion on how to conduct transformative research and how to meet our obligations to explain what we do to society as a whole. Classifying things as pure versus applied versus use-inspired from a ivory tower is not helpful and from my perspective backwards instead of forward looking. I am sorry to be so critical but this must be said.","Canada"

Research funding from public sources should be aimed at early-career researchers to encourage movement of knowledge/fields from status quo positions. Senior scholars are not incentivized to ""shake the boat"" with their own labs and areas of thinking, and have every incentive to keep control of the narrative and direction of fundamental research. This does not bode well for our species and our planet at a time of crises (geo-political, environmental, etc.). Also, senior scholars have made a name for themselves and can get funding from industry and other sources, while junior/early scholars are at a disadvantage from not having published enough (yet). Innovative thinking is often limited for early-career scholars who have to focus research on applied and use-inspired agendas, at the cost of fundamental research. ""Science"" has unfortunately become dogmatic (yes, even in academia) where there is a significant bias toward positivistic theories, which limit broadening the sphere of ideas that can come from other ways of conducting research.   In Canada, the Tri-Council model is dated since much research is now at the links between fields. The Tri-Council is not set up to award thinking across fields, with such meaningless rules such as the use of specific terms indicating the research is suited elsewhere. This re-think of the funding regime is most welcome!","Canada"

The result is a chase of fads and a waste of funds and efforts in the end.  It also encourages group-think and conformity, and stifles creativity and novelty. This scheme ignores the nature of scientific research, which does not proceed neatly according to a logical plan, but progresses in starts and fits and often in unforeseen directions.

Grant Application History  I have two main research grants, one basic research, one applied research involving a company. Obviousy, for the latter, it was necessary to have an industrial partner to obtain the grant. The question you asked did not distinguish the two types of research grants, so it was impossible for me to answer the question accurately.  Also, you have an agenda clearly aimed at trying to persuade governments to move funding in Canada for applied research back into basic research.  However, you may not know nor appreciate that applied research often drives basic research.  So you must not, for example, count all NSERC Collaborative Research and Development research grants as 100% applied research.  A balance is clearly needed.  The balance has been in favor of basic research with no immediate societal benefit.  To try to move the research $ to a more 50/50 division between basic and applied seems reasonable to me.

In my mind, NSERC-funded research should not be applied at all, and that it is industry that needs to make its case to whichever agency will dole out government money intended to foster commercialization, then to seek the academic expertise it requires.

Students are not interested if it doesn't have an immediate application.  I have been very successful in securing funding from the Discovery Grants program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), but grants are quite small compared with other programs/ agencies. I have tried establishing a partnership with a small Pharma company, but they impose restrictions regarding publications and I was unhappy conceding on that point. Another problem I am facing is that my research program uses model organisms and I find myself justifying more often why I use them.   If academics like myself are the ones evaluating grants, then a brainwash must have occurred in the last years, where colleagues in my field have endorsed this model of funding...it is hard to understand.

These programs are aimed at making us more 'productive' and entrepreneurial, but I think the data would show that it does not work.   Rather, this strategy siphons funds from basic research and is generally committed to scientists who already have significant funding, and creating a wider gap between the funded/non-funded.   I believe that the single most important thing Canada could do to increase research productivity and encourage partnerships is to increase basic research funding.  This would allow scientists to take on and train additional students, it would provide some measure of 'funding security', and it would allow us to take more risks to explore unknowns.

Funding for applied and use-inspired research should not be compromised in the name of fundamental research, but more funding for fundamental research is needed.  The requirement to always have matching funds from industry for many government grants skews research to focus only on issues that have some kind of economic incentive. It's not just an applied vs fundamental research issue. Within applied research, the requirement for matching funds a) favors larger industries/sectors at the peril of smaller industries or growing sectors that may have the potential to grow, and b) ignores potential solutions that may not necessarily result in profits for somebody (i.e. ignores societal benefits, etc.) since often there is no 'industry' to fund research into these ideas.

The granting agencies in Canada are putting more of an emphasis on targeted projects. The exception is the NSERC Discovery Grant program, which in my experience funds research that addresses interesting questions irrespective of the potential applications. Unfortunately this is only 40% of the NSERC funding envelope, with more of the funding going to ""innovation"" grants - which typically involve industrial partners - and to ""strategic"" or ""priority"" areas. CIHR grants are now evaluated based on whether they will advance health-related knowledge, care, and/or practices, and is therefore not supporting basic biological research in the way it did in the past (more than 10 years ago).","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","I cannot predict the future. On the one hand, I am sorry that fundamental research is not receiving the recognition it deserves. On the other hand, it is highly risky in terms of return-on-investment - it will cost money over the short term - and this is why industry does not carry out fundamental research (for the most part). Over the long term, I think the investment pays off in terms of education and increasing the science literacy of the population and also opening new frontiers that could help with the challenges we face as a society. I think that researchers need to have realistic expectations about funding levels; the current system operates in a ""winner take all"", with some groups being extremely well funded, to the point that I believe money is being wasted. I would like to see broader and more stable support, perhaps at lower funding levels, for fundamental research.","Medicine and Life Science","1992","Canada","Male","","Canada"

What I have come to realize is that same argument holds for doing applied research.  We cannot necessarily predict how applied research  might benefit fundamental research in the future.  I have found having the two research thrusts to have a synergistic relationship, with both separately valuable benefits and mutually reinforcing benefits.

It is not just the relative amount of pure vs applied research that is worrisome, it is the amount of applied research that is funded by governments.  Governments are funding research for industry, which means industry gains too much control over the direction of government and university research.  The best example is probably vaccine research.  The pharmaceutical industry should focus research on vaccines with a narrow target, preferably seasonal, to maximize profits for shareholders.

But the future outlook is getting worse I think. More and more money is tied to industry (e.g., NSERC Engage, NSERC Strategic Proj. Grants, MITACs, CRIAQ, CARIC, etc.).  ","Will decrease slightly","Can't comment","Will increase considerably","Will stay the same","I think universities will still need to hire faculty, but I think the faculty they hire will be less and less theoretical and more and more applied. This is tragic because it means these applied researchers will not be able, or will be less likely to be able to, answer deep fundamental questions because they are not trained to do so. (They of course can learn how to be theoretical, just as a theoretical person could learn to be more practical, but I think learning to be more theoretical would be harder.)","Engineering","2011","Canada","Male","I think people should elect governments who value fundamental research, and these governments will then maintain and expand programs like the NSERC DG program. However, I think transitioning theoretical research to industry is also very important.   In Canada there is an issue with transition: the issue, in engineering anyway, is that   1) Canadian industry is small, so few companies have the funds to invest in transitioning theoretical research into a product,   2) Canadian industry doesn't really know what research is, or what a PhD is, or how to use a PhD graduate properly.   In my experience, there are WAY TO MANY PhD graduates than are needed by industry. I think some elected official at some point in time had the idea that if we have more PhD graduates it will be better because they can go to industry and help companies innovate. The issue, as I see it, is that these PhD graduates go to industry but are not using their PhD skills. Most PhD graduates are doing work an undergrad or masters graduate could do. Industry needs to be educated, or given an incentive somehow, to actually use the PhD graduates skills.   In the USA, there is sort of the opposite problem. There are lots of companies (e.g., Boeing, Raytheon, UTC, Ford, GM, etc.) that are happy to fit PhD graduates into research positions. These companies are smart about how they ``get PhD graduates in""; what they do, is they fund ``research"" at a University, the research funds are used to pay for the student, and the student does ``research"" on a project of interest to the company. The issue is, in my opinion, that this research is rarely fundamental in nature, and is more often than not very applied and almost just ``advanced"" or ``complicated"" engineering. None the less, it works out well for the company because they get a smart PhD student and a professor (the students supervisor) working on their specific problem for 4 years. Then, that student gets hired right into the company. Very good for the company, but not good for fundamental research. ","Canada"

Engineering undergraduates have options!  Given the choice between earning >$60K/year by landing a job after a Bachelor's degree or earning $12K/year (after tuition) in pursuing a PhD, it's obvious what's going to happen.  -Applied research funding is difficult to get.  Companies are terrified of collaborating with universities because our mission is to publish, which is anathema to companies.  If faculty don't publish, we can't get funded, so what are you supposed to do?! -Universities should not be used as cheap labor for companies.  When a company collaborates with a faculty member in Canada, they basically get free consulting from the professor and really cheap student labor.  How does that help with job creation?? The sad reality is that our politicians and our government bureaucrats are quite ignorant of the day-to-day realities of how businesses work and how universities work because many of them have never worked in either place!

Graduate student stipends have been stuck at the same $12K per year (take-home pay) since the early 1990s.  That's unacceptable.  It's embarrassing to write offer letters for students and tell them what their wage is going to be.  -They need to get rid of university-corporate research grants.  We're not cheap labor. ","Canada"

Here the grant success has gone down slightly in the last decade, but the really big change is in the sizes of grants that are allocated. Typical grant sizes in my field have at best stayed constant in real terms over the last decade. In other words, while people are still getting funded, they can do less with the funding they receive because grant sizes have not nearly kept up with the pace of inflation.   Another subtle effect is that the cost of supporting graduate students is increasing because as government pumps less money into general operating budgets of universities, universities compensate by increasing graduate tuition. As graduate students in most areas of science are supported by their supervisors' grants, we need to pay higher salaries to our students which means we can support fewer students.  This, of course, negatively impacts the overall research output.   Obviously, the grant success fraction gives some measure of government funding, but more subtle effects, such as the two I named above, muddy the picture considerably and, almost certainly, point to a bleaker picture than the simple successful/unsuccessful dichotomy would give.

How could I compare with other researchers having spent the last 5 years publishing several papers every year and supervising several students?   I think my industrial experience is relevant in my field and is an asset to conduct research. For NSERC, it seems that it's a liability.  NSERC needs to review its current policy and give a chance for young researchers to initiate a research program. We cannot be compared with fully established researchers. We spend several days writing grant proposals... most of them are denied, and the lucky ones winning the lottery receive a ridiculous amount of money, a fraction of the budget asked that is barely sufficient to fund a single M.Sc. student. We end up spending more time looking for money than time to do research.

Last year, I got the same amount of funding as I did when I first started as an assistant professor, despite the tens of publications and students I graduated over the decade. The rules of NSERC discovery grants, the most basic and often the only source of funding for most researchers working on fundamental sciences, constantly change, and I feel like no matter how much I improve my proposal, I am constantly getting rankings that gave me meaguer amount of funds that I have to continually shrinking the number of students in my research group. Compared to many other countries (US, China, Europe) etc, the amount of funding devoted to fundamental research is so little that I seriously doubt the government's commitment to promote sciences.   On the other hand, I did try to divert into industrial related research (I am in geophysics, so in principle could collaborate with the hydrocarbon industry). There, I feel like the NSERC fund is only being used to boost a few so-called 'front runners' in the field who already have a lot of industrial connections and frankly a lot of support from industry already. Hence with all the different NSERC programs, they can receive astronomically amount of funds with only a small amount of industrial contribution. I think the government should support industry, but I don't think the government funds should be used to subsidise industry like this at the expense of all the other fundamental research. Needlessly to say, for an early researcher with some ideas hoping to work with industry, but no deep connections, the NSERC industry-collaborative programs success rate is also very low.   I think what should be done by NSERC is to have a stated budget for fundamental research to cover programs like the NSERC discovery grants, and if there is indeed need, special budget can be set up for industrial-collaborative (so-called Applied Research) projects.  Remember for example, in the US, the oil and gas industry are doing their own R&D, and the NSF do not have direct research program to get involved.

Given that I have never worked in industry, I don't have experience I can bring to fill that gap.  I don't want to switch my area of research to become more applied, but I'd like to see myself as part of a continuum rather than in one camp which is totally separate from the applied camp.

Although I beleive that the ultimate goal of research is to enhance society, there needs to be an incubator space where creativity and reflection can occur, and these MUST be outside of the sphere of influence of profit driven industry. 3. Relationships with not-for-profit community entities is not recognized as 'industry' partnership, and the potential for doing relevant work in the community context (which has the potential to enhance society), is not viable in the current push for for-profit research relationships.

Canadian funding for basic research is a mess - other than the (very small) Discovery grants, there simply are no funding programs for basic research. So even though the acceptance rate for Discovery grants is very high, basic research is heavily underfunded. Canada remains the only G7 country to not have bread-and-butter programs where 2-3 faculty  can team up without industry involvement to address medium-to-long-term issues.   At the same time perfect storm is brewing for Strategic grants and essentially all other government funding, whereby Canadian industry contributions are becoming more and more important, while at the same time the attention span of Canadian companies is getting shorter and shorter to the point where most are now only interested in work that can be directly turned into products within months, not years.  If we consider economies that are successful in high tech industries (US, Germany, Japan), they all have significantly higher spending on research with a medium and long term timeline. Disruptive new technologies cannot be developed in an environment where this kind of short term thinking prevails (and I say this as someone who has been involved in several successful startups).   I have been a faculty member in Canada for 15 years, but the steadily worsening situation over that period has finally pushed me to seek other options. I am currently on leave from my Canadian university to work as a faculty member abroad. I won't return to Canada at the end of my leave unless there is a substantial improvement in the situation.

No longer are the grant proposals judged on quality but instead on ""Highly Qualified Personnel"" (the number of grad students passing through your labs and have jobs that are viewed OK by the grant selection committees).

In the last 10 years NSERC established many new grants that required forming a partnership with an industrial partner. NSERC provides funds to match the partners contribution. As a taxpayer I am outraged by this as the taxpayer is footing half the costs for these companies to develop new products. Under these partnerships the company owns all of the IP and the academic researchers are often required to sign non-disclosure agreements. This type of agreement is particularly problematic when pharmaceutical companies or other health care companies are involved as the company can (and often does) charge huge sums of money for drugs or procedures developed with subsidies from taxpayers.  Another problem with this is that companies target their research towards areas that will provide the most profit for them. Problems that may be more pressing for society are not high priority unless the company foresees a profitable product.  ","Canada"

In my opinion, applied research is not just about the use of existing knowledge to develop practical solutions. It is not uncommon to see new 'fundamental' knowledge emerging from applied research or use-inspired research... Also, when it comes to grant applications, there are opportunities to combine all three research types (e.g. fundamental, use-inspired, and applied); so it was difficult for me to complete this survey as most of my research projects combine all three types of research. For some of us, research is the pursuit of knowledge to understand natural phenomena and processes, which can also be useful to address societal issues or to develop practical solutions to specific challenges... Quite a blend isn't it!? I would end this comment by adding that even the for-profit sector (at least in my field) is willing to support a certain level of fundamental research... of course they presumably do it only if they see it can potentially generate new 'useful' knowledge in the long run. Anyways, good luck sorting out all the results and interpreting them!   ","Canada"

Researchers involved in those sorts of partnerships tend to develop a very strong work ethic, and work in a fast-paced manner in order to satisfy crystallized project deliverables for external stakeholders. Productivity is not typically measured, however, and publications. But, it's my belief that applied research also feeds back to fundamental research because of the cultural productivity shift. Studies in this country show that the most successful researchers in pure science are the most successful across categories, indicating a buffered economy, and an ability to move skills from one arena to the other. Certainly a balance of everything is important, and going to far down any path is a bad idea. ",""

So, in my opinion, use-inspired research is fundamental research in Computer Science.  There are people working on obscure questions with no known end uses, but they are in a very small minority.    What is most troubling about research in Canada today is the focus on niche / boutiquey risk-free areas of research where Canada could potentially lead without facing competition from elsewhere, at the expense of important areas with particularly challenging problems.  I also see growing interest among Canadian Computer Science researchers to strategically pursue risk-free, low-investment, high-paper-output areas with likelihood of higher citations, such as work evaluating artifacts created by others rather than creating something of their own.  This seems to be motivated in part by the shallow bean-counting happening in tenure/promotion/merit/grant evaluation committees.  ","Canada"

NSERC also provides 5 years of funding on Discovery Grants, and the stability of funding is also incredibly important for fundamental research (especially for new recruits to an institution), as the timelines on ""results"" can be longer term and within expectations of a program of research rather than a project. The research funded from CIHR and SSHRC (the 2 other Canadian federal funding agencies) is more project oriented, and funding is not necessarily in 5-year allocations. It IS important to consider whether the system of peer review is considered objective, or whether there is a male bias in funding awards or research accomplishments/expertise. In my experience this pattern (the bias that favourably reviews male applicants at the cost of funding fewer female applicants) is the case. This pattern is at the base of a system of awarding research chairs (more prestigious than ""just a job as a researcher or faculty member"") more often than not, places such high-status awards on male scientists. At least in Canada, we need to work at changing that!","Canada"

In Canada NSERC still tends more towards the 1950s the failed 'Big Science' concept and engineering and technology have to look elsewhere for reasonable amounts of funding for research, scholarships etc. The low levels and increasing lack of success in grant applications especially for engineers is part of the reason for Canada's innovative gap. It also means that even successful engineering researchers have to turn to theoretical studies and/or simulations rather than empirical research. However I think that all research in academia is underfunded and has become worse because a 'heroes and zeroes' approach has been adopted. The universal involvement of all academics was a strong suite of the Canadian system. For engineers the NSERC grant was a membership card which enable them to pursue further external funding. Now for young researchers if they do not follow a more science based route their chances of NSERC success are limited.    ","Canada"

At the base or foundation is basic/fundamental research, in the middle might be a gradation of translational research that expands on the fundamental research.  This can be anything from translating studies in invertebrate model organisms to vertebrate or human cells, to using basic knowledge to identify drug targets, to developing biomarkers for disease.  At the top are cures, which are very rare, make great news headlines and are absolutely dependent on the fundamental research as the base.  Without fundamental research, there is no knowledge base to support translational studies and the development of cures and medical treatments.  It is easy for the government and lay people to be short sighted and not recognize the value of the fundamental research and focus attention on curing diseases.

It's really about building trust, capitalizing on their curiosity, and being creative and fundamental while meeting their needs. ","Canada"

This shift also changed my career perspective as I have strong doubts that there will be enough employment opportunities in the academia.  I am working in geological sciences and noticed that most of the fundamental research is completed as a by-product of applied research. This is principally OK, but there is no continuity in a particular area of fundamental research as the goals of applied research change cyclically with the industrial development (e.g., commodity cycle). In this context, the strong dependence on industry funds basically allows the industry to control what research should be done and when, solely based on their interests, which can be very short-lived.","Canada"

In my view, this often forces researchers to put a spin on their work towards these applications.  In many cases, the spin not genuine and therefore wastes precious research funding that could be better spent on basic science.    My field (neuroscience) is so new that even though there are many real applications, there is also so much potential for basic research to understand the human brain in ways that will provide the foundations for future applications.  Science is full of so many examples of curiosity-driven research that eventually led to powerful applications.  If only the politicians better understood this.","Japan"
