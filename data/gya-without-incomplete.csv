PLEASE kindly keep what I say below CONFIDENTIAL as it makes me identifiable:  I was based in Australia for most of the past 10 years, but most of my research was focused in China, and then I moved to the UK. In China, my impression was there has been an increase in investment across all three types of research (in terms of fundamental research, the increase was in basic science, but not for humanity or social sciences). In Australia, there were rounds and rounds of cuts to university and research funding.  Many of my senior colleagues lost their jobs in the process. In the UK, my impression is that it is much easier to find funding for fundamental research in social sciences relative to Australia and China, but that is a cross-context impression.  I haven't looked into the history of UK research funding.","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","","If the pots of money do not increase for fundamental research in the 3 countries I mentioned (for China, fundamental research in social science and humanity, and especially in humanity), we won't have a next generation of scholar in many interesting research area.","Social Science / Humanities","2008","United Kingdom","Female","Netherlands"

How this funding will generate fundamental research without any support for research activities?    Secondly, the mandatory requirement of Canadian industry partner is also harming quite a lot while obtaining funding for Fundamental research. Traditionally (with my little experience) I realised Canadian industry does not have appreciation towards the fundamental research. In this scenario if an early career researcher like me involves any international company to support fundamental research the researcher is penalised by charging overhead on the funding given by this industry. Unfortunately, this scenario not only makes researcher feel discouraged and unfair but also the company feels - who are willing to come to Canada and bringing their world class technology to Canadian researchers -  that they are unwelcome to Canada.  It is confusing to me how this is not eligible since the money is coming to Canada, funding is generating salaries for HQPs or even in this case one job position in Canada but still NSERC doesn't recognise this partnership as an eligible partnership.

For me responding to this survey has been frustrating because I think it missed the MAJOR shift in research funding that happened Canada-wide in the 1990s.  The per capita decrease in support for fundamental research, especially through the Federal grant councils has been most disheartening. We have all been pushed into currying favours from industry, accepting significant personal risks when taking on graduate students and pursuing things that hold little interest for us.  I would NOT pursue an academic career today if I could start again, and I can tell you that the best Canadian students are leaving the research path in droves. There is nothing noble or desirable about being a 'research whore' or about accepting (often stupid and uniformed) research direction from those with very little understanding of research or from failed academics who could not win or hold down a research appointment themselves. The system is seriously broken and it is going to cost Canadians significantly in the long run. I doubt we will be collectively smart enough to understand that it could have been better.","Natural Science","1979","Canada","Male",""

To get these grants there must be companies or government agencies signed on, which seems like the government wanting to see partnerships as a 'legitimising' litmus test for grant applications. NSERC also offers curiosity based ""Discovery Grants"" but these are rather small awards. Genome Canada is another funding agency that is skewed heavily towards applied research. Many canadian funding sources demand that ""matching funding"" is in place - this seems like a mechanism whereby agencies don't have the budget (or, I'd say, don't have the courage) to fund a full project. It also offloads the decision making to others, i.e., if there's matching funding from someone else, the research must be a good idea.","Will increase slightly","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Many are hopeful that the new Liberal government, elected in Fall 2015, will re-energize basic/fundamental/curiosity driven research through new mechanisms in the research funding landscape.

They did not require to collaborate with Industry and others, and complete fundamental researches were sufficiently funded. In Canada, in my impression, except NSERC Discovery (very small fund; in Japan, this scale fund is for very early stage young researchers. Professors and associate professors in the top ranked universities do not apply to such small scale fund.), we need to find the fund partner in industry, NPO or others. In my personal case, the industries do not like to support the fundamental research at all. Hence, at the present, my priority is to conduct used-inspired research.

What matters is that we get funding to carry out research without bickering about what is applied or not as long as we   - work on the right questions; - are aware of our responsibility to conduct research that benefits society somehow in the vaguest sense. Insisting on the right of carrying out complete blue sky research without any form of justification is no longer of these times and reeks of an unhealthy sense of entitlement.","Will decrease considerably","Will decrease considerably","Will decrease considerably","","I am afraid that the amount of red taping is only going to increase. In addition, the inability and unwillingness of the scientific community to justify their research is not helping. Again, making a distinction between pure and applied science is futile. We need to look at the quality of research and support areas of strength -- i.e., we need to make choices rather than spreading stuff around. This also means that we need to communicate better how our research benefits society. While I understand that that is easier said than done in certain research areas it is our ultimate responsibility to do so or to at least make an attempt. To just negate that responsibility under the pretence  of pure research is ill conceived and frankly disrespectful to researchers who are pushing the envelope on research that happen to have an application. This leads to a downward spiral in a funding climate (ad societal climate) in which the community should embrace their responsibility to justify their research funding in the context of good science and some down the road perhaps remote but arguable ""application"".  Phrased differently (the website forced me to rewrite)  Making a distinction between pure and applied research is futile. We as a community have a responsibility to explain why what we do is important. While In understand it is easier for certain research areas than others to justify funding, complete refusal to commit to this responsibility under the pretense of ""pure"" research is not only disrespectful to researchers that are making this effort it also sends a wrong message to society as a whole. If we can not meet the bar of relating our work to some ""application"" however remote, we do not have the right to ask society to support us. Having said this research does of course need to meet a high standard excluding exercises in commercialization by ""researchers"" that do not even know what it takes to carry out a research program of international standard.","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1997","Canada","Male","Canada"

The result is a chase of fads and a waste of funds and efforts in the end.  It also encourages group-think and conformity, and stifles creativity and novelty. This scheme ignores the nature of scientific research, which does not proceed neatly according to a logical plan, but progresses in starts and fits and often in unforeseen directions. A more appropriate model is to fund many small projects based on free exploration by individual researchers, and let science take its course.","Will increase slightly","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1995","Canada","Male","Canada"

The granting agencies in Canada are putting more of an emphasis on targeted projects. The exception is the NSERC Discovery Grant program, which in my experience funds research that addresses interesting questions irrespective of the potential applications. Unfortunately this is only 40% of the NSERC funding envelope, with more of the funding going to ""innovation"" grants - which typically involve industrial partners - and to ""strategic"" or ""priority"" areas. CIHR grants are now evaluated based on whether they will advance health-related knowledge, care, and/or practices, and is therefore not supporting basic biological research in the way it did in the past (more than 10 years ago).","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","I cannot predict the future. On the one hand, I am sorry that fundamental research is not receiving the recognition it deserves. On the other hand, it is highly risky in terms of return-on-investment - it will cost money over the short term - and this is why industry does not carry out fundamental research (for the most part). Over the long term, I think the investment pays off in terms of education and increasing the science literacy of the population and also opening new frontiers that could help with the challenges we face as a society. I think that researchers need to have realistic expectations about funding levels; the current system operates in a ""winner take all"", with some groups being extremely well funded, to the point that I believe money is being wasted. I would like to see broader and more stable support, perhaps at lower funding levels, for fundamental research.","Medicine and Life Science","1992","Canada","Male","Canada"

Engineering undergraduates have options!  Given the choice between earning >$60K/year by landing a job after a Bachelor's degree or earning $12K/year (after tuition) in pursuing a PhD, it's obvious what's going to happen.  -Applied research funding is difficult to get.  Companies are terrified of collaborating with universities because our mission is to publish, which is anathema to companies.  If faculty don't publish, we can't get funded, so what are you supposed to do?! -Universities should not be used as cheap labor for companies.  When a company collaborates with a faculty member in Canada, they basically get free consulting from the professor and really cheap student labor.  How does that help with job creation?? The sad reality is that our politicians and our government bureaucrats are quite ignorant of the day-to-day realities of how businesses work and how universities work because many of them have never worked in either place!

Last year, I got the same amount of funding as I did when I first started as an assistant professor, despite the tens of publications and students I graduated over the decade. The rules of NSERC discovery grants, the most basic and often the only source of funding for most researchers working on fundamental sciences, constantly change, and I feel like no matter how much I improve my proposal, I am constantly getting rankings that gave me meaguer amount of funds that I have to continually shrinking the number of students in my research group. Compared to many other countries (US, China, Europe) etc, the amount of funding devoted to fundamental research is so little that I seriously doubt the government's commitment to promote sciences.   On the other hand, I did try to divert into industrial related research (I am in geophysics, so in principle could collaborate with the hydrocarbon industry). There, I feel like the NSERC fund is only being used to boost a few so-called 'front runners' in the field who already have a lot of industrial connections and frankly a lot of support from industry already. Hence with all the different NSERC programs, they can receive astronomically amount of funds with only a small amount of industrial contribution. I think the government should support industry, but I don't think the government funds should be used to subsidise industry like this at the expense of all the other fundamental research. Needlessly to say, for an early researcher with some ideas hoping to work with industry, but no deep connections, the NSERC industry-collaborative programs success rate is also very low.   I think what should be done by NSERC is to have a stated budget for fundamental research to cover programs like the NSERC discovery grants, and if there is indeed need, special budget can be set up for industrial-collaborative (so-called Applied Research) projects.  Remember for example, in the US, the oil and gas industry are doing their own R&D, and the NSF do not have direct research program to get involved.

Although I beleive that the ultimate goal of research is to enhance society, there needs to be an incubator space where creativity and reflection can occur, and these MUST be outside of the sphere of influence of profit driven industry. 3. Relationships with not-for-profit community entities is not recognized as 'industry' partnership, and the potential for doing relevant work in the community context (which has the potential to enhance society), is not viable in the current push for for-profit research relationships.

I'm hopeful that the new government will listen to the research community that is stating loudly that basic science has been undermined in recent years and this trend needs to be reversed. If this doesn't happen, and the government and CIHR continue with their mandate to preferentially fund applied research applications, the country will fall behind on a global scale.   Immunotherapies and gene editing techniques that receive widespread news coverage for their impact on human health have long histories in basic, fundamental, curiosity-driven research.

At the base or foundation is basic/fundamental research, in the middle might be a gradation of translational research that expands on the fundamental research.  This can be anything from translating studies in invertebrate model organisms to vertebrate or human cells, to using basic knowledge to identify drug targets, to developing biomarkers for disease.  At the top are cures, which are very rare, make great news headlines and are absolutely dependent on the fundamental research as the base.  Without fundamental research, there is no knowledge base to support translational studies and the development of cures and medical treatments.  It is easy for the government and lay people to be short sighted and not recognize the value of the fundamental research and focus attention on curing diseases.  This the is direction research funding in Canada is going.

Priority-wise the subjects chosen Science are for engineering, medicine, computer science, genetic engineering, pharmacy, microbiology, biochemistry & molecular biology, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, soil science.

It is highly discouraging, and time consuming, in a period where we also have to start teaching, with the large amount of work required to build new courses. How can we have a little of balance in our life, and have a family? Still not sure it can be done... and it might make me quit a job I that I really appreciate A LOT.  To some degree, it makes me feel that obtaining a grant is even more a lotterie than it was before, and more related to what the reviewer think of your research topic than work quality. This feeling is further support by comments of co-worker, who highlights the luck related to getting funding. Grand application seems to have become, to some extend, a popularity contest: ""my resaerch topic is more cool than yours"", and ""I know more people than you do : see how many reknown collaborators I have been able to found"".
