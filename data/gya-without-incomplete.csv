PLEASE kindly keep what I say below CONFIDENTIAL as it makes me identifiable:  I was based in Australia for most of the past 10 years, but most of my research was focused in China, and then I moved to the UK. In China, my impression was there has been an increase in investment across all three types of research (in terms of fundamental research, the increase was in basic science, but not for humanity or social sciences). In Australia, there were rounds and rounds of cuts to university and research funding.  Many of my senior colleagues lost their jobs in the process. In the UK, my impression is that it is much easier to find funding for fundamental research in social sciences relative to Australia and China, but that is a cross-context impression.  I haven't looked into the history of UK research funding.","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","","If the pots of money do not increase for fundamental research in the 3 countries I mentioned (for China, fundamental research in social science and humanity, and especially in humanity), we won't have a next generation of scholar in many interesting research area.","Social Science / Humanities","2008","United Kingdom","Female","Netherlands","United Kingdom"

My overriding concern is that industry funding exerts subtle pressure to get the results wished for or to spin data in that direction as I've seen that done.

How this funding will generate fundamental research without any support for research activities?    Secondly, the mandatory requirement of Canadian industry partner is also harming quite a lot while obtaining funding for Fundamental research. Traditionally (with my little experience) I realised Canadian industry does not have appreciation towards the fundamental research. In this scenario if an early career researcher like me involves any international company to support fundamental research the researcher is penalised by charging overhead on the funding given by this industry. Unfortunately, this scenario not only makes researcher feel discouraged and unfair but also the company feels - who are willing to come to Canada and bringing their world class technology to Canadian researchers -  that they are unwelcome to Canada.  It is confusing to me how this is not eligible since the money is coming to Canada, funding is generating salaries for HQPs or even in this case one job position in Canada but still NSERC doesn't recognise this partnership as an eligible partnership.

For me responding to this survey has been frustrating because I think it missed the MAJOR shift in research funding that happened Canada-wide in the 1990s.  The per capita decrease in support for fundamental research, especially through the Federal grant councils has been most disheartening. We have all been pushed into currying favours from industry, accepting significant personal risks when taking on graduate students and pursuing things that hold little interest for us.  I would NOT pursue an academic career today if I could start again, and I can tell you that the best Canadian students are leaving the research path in droves. There is nothing noble or desirable about being a 'research whore' or about accepting (often stupid and uniformed) research direction from those with very little understanding of research or from failed academics who could not win or hold down a research appointment themselves.

To get these grants there must be companies or government agencies signed on, which seems like the government wanting to see partnerships as a 'legitimising' litmus test for grant applications. NSERC also offers curiosity based ""Discovery Grants"" but these are rather small awards. Genome Canada is another funding agency that is skewed heavily towards applied research. Many canadian funding sources demand that ""matching funding"" is in place - this seems like a mechanism whereby agencies don't have the budget (or, I'd say, don't have the courage) to fund a full project. It also offloads the decision making to others, i.e., if there's matching funding from someone else, the research must be a good idea.","Will increase slightly","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Many are hopeful that the new Liberal government, elected in Fall 2015, will re-energize basic/fundamental/curiosity driven research through new mechanisms in the research funding landscape.

They did not require to collaborate with Industry and others, and complete fundamental researches were sufficiently funded. In Canada, in my impression, except NSERC Discovery (very small fund; in Japan, this scale fund is for very early stage young researchers. Professors and associate professors in the top ranked universities do not apply to such small scale fund.), we need to find the fund partner in industry, NPO or others. In my personal case, the industries do not like to support the fundamental research at all. Hence, at the present, my priority is to conduct used-inspired research. Certainly, this strengthens the competition power of industry, but this weakens the competition of hunting the jobs by graduate students in the world.","Will decrease considerably","Will increase slightly","Can't comment","Will decrease considerably","If our students look for the jobs within Canada, I guess this may not be problem.

What matters is that we get funding to carry out research without bickering about what is applied or not as long as we   - work on the right questions; - are aware of our responsibility to conduct research that benefits society somehow in the vaguest sense. Insisting on the right of carrying out complete blue sky research without any form of justification is no longer of these times and reeks of an unhealthy sense of entitlement.","Will decrease considerably","Will decrease considerably","Will decrease considerably","","I am afraid that the amount of red taping is only going to increase. In addition, the inability and unwillingness of the scientific community to justify their research is not helping. Again, making a distinction between pure and applied science is futile. We need to look at the quality of research and support areas of strength -- i.e., we need to make choices rather than spreading stuff around. This also means that we need to communicate better how our research benefits society. While I understand that that is easier said than done in certain research areas it is our ultimate responsibility to do so or to at least make an attempt. To just negate that responsibility under the pretence  of pure research is ill conceived and frankly disrespectful to researchers who are pushing the envelope on research that happen to have an application. This leads to a downward spiral in a funding climate (ad societal climate) in which the community should embrace their responsibility to justify their research funding in the context of good science and some down the road perhaps remote but arguable ""application"".  Phrased differently (the website forced me to rewrite)  Making a distinction between pure and applied research is futile. We as a community have a responsibility to explain why what we do is important. While In understand it is easier for certain research areas than others to justify funding, complete refusal to commit to this responsibility under the pretense of ""pure"" research is not only disrespectful to researchers that are making this effort it also sends a wrong message to society as a whole. If we can not meet the bar of relating our work to some ""application"" however remote, we do not have the right to ask society to support us. Having said this research does of course need to meet a high standard excluding exercises in commercialization by ""researchers"" that do not even know what it takes to carry out a research program of international standard.","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1997","Canada","Male","Canada","Canada"

Such an approach, if well-intentioned, invariably fails because government agencies and even scientists themselves cannot accurately predict in what area the next technological breakthrough will be.  The result is a chase of fads and a waste of funds and efforts in the end.  It also encourages group-think and conformity, and stifles creativity and novelty. This scheme ignores the nature of scientific research, which does not proceed neatly according to a logical plan, but progresses in starts and fits and often in unforeseen directions. A more appropriate model is to fund many small projects based on free exploration by individual researchers, and let science take its course.","Will increase slightly","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1995","Canada","Male","Canada","Canada"

The granting agencies in Canada are putting more of an emphasis on targeted projects. The exception is the NSERC Discovery Grant program, which in my experience funds research that addresses interesting questions irrespective of the potential applications. Unfortunately this is only 40% of the NSERC funding envelope, with more of the funding going to ""innovation"" grants - which typically involve industrial partners - and to ""strategic"" or ""priority"" areas. CIHR grants are now evaluated based on whether they will advance health-related knowledge, care, and/or practices, and is therefore not supporting basic biological research in the way it did in the past (more than 10 years ago).","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","Can't comment","I cannot predict the future. On the one hand, I am sorry that fundamental research is not receiving the recognition it deserves. On the other hand, it is highly risky in terms of return-on-investment - it will cost money over the short term - and this is why industry does not carry out fundamental research (for the most part). Over the long term, I think the investment pays off in terms of education and increasing the science literacy of the population and also opening new frontiers that could help with the challenges we face as a society. I think that researchers need to have realistic expectations about funding levels; the current system operates in a ""winner take all"", with some groups being extremely well funded, to the point that I believe money is being wasted. I would like to see broader and more stable support, perhaps at lower funding levels, for fundamental research.","Medicine and Life Science","1992","Canada","Male","Canada","Canada"

Engineering undergraduates have options!  Given the choice between earning >$60K/year by landing a job after a Bachelor's degree or earning $12K/year (after tuition) in pursuing a PhD, it's obvious what's going to happen.  -Applied research funding is difficult to get.  Companies are terrified of collaborating with universities because our mission is to publish, which is anathema to companies.  If faculty don't publish, we can't get funded, so what are you supposed to do?! -Universities should not be used as cheap labor for companies.  When a company collaborates with a faculty member in Canada, they basically get free consulting from the professor and really cheap student labor.  How does that help with job creation?? The sad reality is that our politicians and our government bureaucrats are quite ignorant of the day-to-day realities of how businesses work and how universities work because many of them have never worked in either place!

Last year, I got the same amount of funding as I did when I first started as an assistant professor, despite the tens of publications and students I graduated over the decade. The rules of NSERC discovery grants, the most basic and often the only source of funding for most researchers working on fundamental sciences, constantly change, and I feel like no matter how much I improve my proposal, I am constantly getting rankings that gave me meaguer amount of funds that I have to continually shrinking the number of students in my research group. Compared to many other countries (US, China, Europe) etc, the amount of funding devoted to fundamental research is so little that I seriously doubt the government's commitment to promote sciences.   On the other hand, I did try to divert into industrial related research (I am in geophysics, so in principle could collaborate with the hydrocarbon industry). There, I feel like the NSERC fund is only being used to boost a few so-called 'front runners' in the field who already have a lot of industrial connections and frankly a lot of support from industry already. Hence with all the different NSERC programs, they can receive astronomically amount of funds with only a small amount of industrial contribution. I think the government should support industry, but I don't think the government funds should be used to subsidise industry like this at the expense of all the other fundamental research. Needlessly to say, for an early researcher with some ideas hoping to work with industry, but no deep connections, the NSERC industry-collaborative programs success rate is also very low.   I think what should be done by NSERC is to have a stated budget for fundamental research to cover programs like the NSERC discovery grants, and if there is indeed need, special budget can be set up for industrial-collaborative (so-called Applied Research) projects.  Remember for example, in the US, the oil and gas industry are doing their own R&D, and the NSF do not have direct research program to get involved.

Building relationships for applied research takes years. If applied research with industry partners is mandatory, then new faculty will be inclined to stay in their local regions which may prevent expanding their scope of work.  2. Forcing partnership with industry is VERY misguided. Although I beleive that the ultimate goal of research is to enhance society, there needs to be an incubator space where creativity and reflection can occur, and these MUST be outside of the sphere of influence of profit driven industry. 3. Relationships with not-for-profit community entities is not recognized as 'industry' partnership, and the potential for doing relevant work in the community context (which has the potential to enhance society), is not viable in the current push for for-profit research relationships.

In addition, the vast majority of research money has been focused towards short-term industry issues effectively putting public research money into enriching the corporations (getting researchers and industry research done for pennies on the dollar...for example most Mitacs grants and many NSERC grants) rather than using that money for actual research discoveries.

But if the total expenditure remains the same, it's likely that the same number of careers will be generated, although it might select for different individuals depending on how that funding is distributed across categories.","Natural Science","2006","Canada","Male","","Canada"

At the base or foundation is basic/fundamental research, in the middle might be a gradation of translational research that expands on the fundamental research.  This can be anything from translating studies in invertebrate model organisms to vertebrate or human cells, to using basic knowledge to identify drug targets, to developing biomarkers for disease.  At the top are cures, which are very rare, make great news headlines and are absolutely dependent on the fundamental research as the base.  Without fundamental research, there is no knowledge base to support translational studies and the development of cures and medical treatments.  It is easy for the government and lay people to be short sighted and not recognize the value of the fundamental research and focus attention on curing diseases.  This the is direction research funding in Canada is going.

Priority-wise the subjects chosen Science are for engineering, medicine, computer science, genetic engineering, pharmacy, microbiology, biochemistry & molecular biology, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, soil science. One of the least priorities is agriculture. So although the funding is highest in Agricultural Research, the best of students choose to study in general universities and not agricultural ones.

It is highly discouraging, and time consuming, in a period where we also have to start teaching, with the large amount of work required to build new courses. How can we have a little of balance in our life, and have a family? Still not sure it can be done... and it might make me quit a job I that I really appreciate A LOT.  To some degree, it makes me feel that obtaining a grant is even more a lotterie than it was before, and more related to what the reviewer think of your research topic than work quality. This feeling is further support by comments of co-worker, who highlights the luck related to getting funding.

Most scientists, especially young people, are curiosity driven. The ability to change direction in view of new results or developments is critical to research AND the commercialisation of research. The current system forces research into the more boring engineering-type studies which do not inspire innovation which are less interesting for students. More importantly, the availability for research positions is drastically diminished, there is no permanency associated with this kind of work. It would be foolhardy for any but the most committed and talented people to pursue research in Australia. Luckily, I feel that because of good and inspiring science education in primary school, there is a strong core of talented young people available in Australia, and they are highly committed despite the terrible work prospects.","Physical Science (eg. math, physics, chemistry, computer science)","1991","Australia","Male","Australia","Australia"

This has meant a change from very low levels of funding that was additionally unpredictable in dates and rules to a modest but at least level of funding that is at least predictable. This has been accompanied by a strong emphasis on applied research. Our research community is generally not mature for really good applied research. This has led many researchers to disguise their basic research projects into applied ones in order the obtain funding. Hence considerable funds have been allocated to researchers that would otherwise not be competitive, via such ""disguised"" projects. The priority given by government to applied research applies also to posgraduate student scholarships and to so-called ""initiation"" research grants (aimed at PhD students). This last aspect is particularly undesirable, because it deviates students away from obtaining their initial training in the context of good science, into possibly not-so-good ""applied"" science. ","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Will stay the same","Will decrease slightly","There is a strong trend at the moment for a decrease in undergraduante enrolment in careers perceived to have research as their only (or main) area of employment. This of course impact on the number of young people undertaking careers in science.   The trend just mentioned does not necessarily follow recent trends in research funding (as funding overall has increased over the last 10 years). It instead reflects a cultural change, from idealism (I'll study what I like best) to realism (I'll study what will secure me a good living in material terms). More specifically, the trends reflects the disillusionment of the younger generations with the harsh career bottleneck that prevents many PhD graduates from securing tenure in academia, combined with the lack of (satisfactory) jobs for PhD graduates outside academia.   In short, the modest increase in science funding has not been enough to counter the decrease in number of students. Of course, a hypothetical strong increase in investment in science now could reverse the existing trend. In the absence of such investment increase, the existing trend will only continue or aggravate itself. ","Medicine and Life Science","1997","Uruguay","Male","Uruguay","Uruguay"

Thus, problems and projects of timely importance with theoretic and practical values are highly valued since it is immediately impacting lives of people. However, when the nation become developed, say like the U.S, you need to go beyond the frontiers of present day knowledge towards understanding of the universe around us. Basic problems in quantum studies, replicating energy efficiency and synthesis in plants towards our energy needs or even life exploration beyond earth and 'lifetronics' are possibly some of many themes for tomorrow's research.   Earth is still a point mass in this universe. There are plenty of basic problems to be explored to make life better and for our own understanding of the 'self', and processes, phenomena and networks of 'nature'. Necessity is the mother of all inventions and discovery.

It requires special skills, innate talent, intuition and hard work within a multidisciplinary thrust, all in one package. One cannot pump in money to every researcher as fundamental. It is on successful delivery after a fixed but long time period, one can see its impact. However, one must note that fundamental work can lead to new fields and technology impact. It must be supported. India is pushing this. Technological impact can eventually lead to solutions to make our lives better. Some researchers do basic work, some applied, some a mixture of both. Eventually, one needs to have a portfolio of both basic and applied research through grants to see research missions/programs successful and fuel a new generation of students to carry the torch forward globally across. In short, I see that fundamental research will pace up in next few years considerably since applied work can be partnered with industry for profits.
