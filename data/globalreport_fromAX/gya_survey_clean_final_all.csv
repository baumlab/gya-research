PLEASE kindly keep what I say below CONFIDENTIAL as it makes me identifiable:  I was based in Australia for most of the past 10 years, but most of my research was focused in China, and then I moved to the UK. In China, my impression was there has been an increase in investment across all three types of research (in terms of fundamental research, the increase was in basic science, but not for humanity or social sciences). In Australia, there were rounds and rounds of cuts to university and research funding.  Many of my senior colleagues lost their jobs in the process. In the UK, my impression is that it is much easier to find funding for fundamental research in social sciences relative to Australia and China, but that is a cross-context impression.  I haven't looked into the history of UK research funding.","If the pots of money do not increase for fundamental research in the 3 countries I mentioned (for China, fundamental research in social science and humanity, and especially in humanity), we won't have a next generation of scholar in many interesting research area.",Thank you for investing effort into designing and conducting the survey! ,High Income

There will be more jobs in more countries than the usual ones. In my country of origin there is no money and no jobs, flat. IN my country of adoption hirings are linked to grants but having a grant is not yet mandatory, but it is becoming an element of important priority in hiring decisions because my university is considering paying only teaching hours and let researchers find their own money for research outside regular appointments (i.e. outsource research to grant agencies)","There is just too little money for blue sky research (ie even the research time allowed in university positions is being reduced either in practice, by exploiting academics or forcing them to get grants to fund their own research).

","My experience is that it is increasingly impossible to get funding and/or a job unless you are doing something that can be 'sold' with a direct benefit.

Sometime we cannot remember the grants information so well and therefore may simply answer with rough figures. 3.

Younger researchers have either drunk the Kool-Aid that they have to partner with industry, or are doing it to just survive and have careers. My overriding concern is that industry funding exerts subtle pressure to get the results wished for or to spin data in that direction as I've seen that done.    Deans still like- and prefer -NIH funds because those come with hefty indirect funds which they say they use to support grant support services- but some of which they can funnel to their pets/projects . Not sure where this is all going to end up for the future of research and integrity.",These new generations want work-life balance- industry funds will fill the funding hole for some but others will leave and pursue related areas of work as opposed to bench research.,"I started a new field of research - but not sure if I'm going to be able to get any more NIH funding to keep going.  I have to pursue industry dollars together with clinical colleagues but will keep trying to get NIH money as my administration values that the most.    As scientists, we all have to pitch in to help save basic research and restore it to the prominence it deserves as the underpinning of the economy and advancement of the sciences.  In the USA, many highly placed scientists have already voiced their concerns, criticisms, and suggestions for change in the strongest terms.  Many of us are trying to fight back as best we know how but it is an ugly struggle.  The public is demanding ""accountability"" - but we have an increasingly ignorant and enumerate public that mostly can't judge the value of basic research and that really doesn't trust scientists, sadly.   Thanks for doing this survey- MUCH needed!  I look forward to the results.  Likely to be very sobering!  Good luck. ",High Income

I would also argue that the movement of money from general research to focused research for chairs of excellence, industry chairs, etc - is also a fundamentally flawed move.  Most universities want chairs, who do not teach much, and download teaching onto already stressed faculty who are further distracted from research.   SO - funding for fundamental research is only part of the problem. By all means lets have more of it. But we also need to move back and support more people, with smaller grants and less extreme expectations.  NSERC operationg grants used to be the envy of the scientific world. If we want to entice and keep people interested in research throughout their careers, then an adequate support system is needed. Picking winners in scientific research is hit and miss and too often we bring an end to promising careers. ",High Income

And there is no one to fund this. So our products and research then is incremental improvements on past ideas, not creative revolutionary discoveries. This needs to change back.

Years ago, this was always the case but has decreased in recent time such that only the strongest, most experience researchers have received grants. This has the effect of muscling out the younger researchers before they are even given the chance to get started.","It has become all too commonplace in many fields that governments ignore the funding of basic research. Recent focus it seems has turned to funding only those research projects that have immediate application to society or industry. Although this funding philosophy leads to immediate turnover of new research products, the lack of funding toward fundamental research means that researchers must continue to use outdated or inefficient tools or research techniques in realizing the new product. If fundamental research could be supported along with the expectation of producing outcomes with applications, then researchers might improve those tools used to achieve the application product and thereby improve the outcome of the product.

In Japan, I had more than $500K/year research fund for more than 10 years. Nearly 100% of these funds came from Government. They did not require to collaborate with Industry and others, and complete fundamental researches were sufficiently funded. In Canada, in my impression, except NSERC Discovery (very small fund; in Japan, this scale fund is for very early stage young researchers. Professors and associate professors in the top ranked universities do not apply to such small scale fund.), we need to find the fund partner in industry, NPO or others. In my personal case, the industries do not like to support the fundamental research at all. Hence, at the present, my priority is to conduct used-inspired research. Certainly, this strengthens the competition power of industry, but this weakens the competition of hunting the jobs by graduate students in the world.","If our students look for the jobs within Canada, I guess this may not be problem. However, as Prof. Obama said to the high school students of US some years ago, if our students have to compete with other students (from China, India, Middle East countries, etc.) in the same generation all over the world, the lack of fundamental and advance knowledge/skill/experience will be a critical weak point.

These programs are aimed at making us more 'productive' and entrepreneurial, but I think the data would show that it does not work.   Rather, this strategy siphons funds from basic research and is generally committed to scientists who already have significant funding, and creating a wider gap between the funded/non-funded.   I believe that the single most important thing Canada could do to increase research productivity and encourage partnerships is to increase basic research funding.  This would allow scientists to take on and train additional students, it would provide some measure of 'funding security', and it would allow us to take more risks to explore unknowns.  This will drive natural collaborations and partnerships. ",High Income

For this question, I think it's a good thing that applied research has room at the table as it was an important missing piece of the puzzle (your timelines are pretty short, 2006 - changes away from supporting fundamental and use-inspired research were underway before 2006).  The difficult thing is that no or little new money was infused when applied research was added, and many agencies have insisted that there be an applied component to all research, which is not always logical or possible.","The research world is far more complicated and with many more players.  I think the difficulty will be in getting funding for sure and for younger scientists having to answer to many different ""bosses"". For example, large pots of money that could go to support research are currently used for salary awards, especially early career awards.  many times positions are not suitably backstopped, or people in these positions are required to do more research (e.g. 70-80% of their time), but that's difficult without grants.  It gets very complicated.  ",0,High Income

Funding for applied and use-inspired research should not be compromised in the name of fundamental research, but more funding for fundamental research is needed.  The requirement to always have matching funds from industry for many government grants skews research to focus only on issues that have some kind of economic incentive. It's not just an applied vs fundamental research issue. Within applied research, the requirement for matching funds a) favors larger industries/sectors at the peril of smaller industries or growing sectors that may have the potential to grow, and b) ignores potential solutions that may not necessarily result in profits for somebody (i.e. ignores societal benefits, etc.) since often there is no 'industry' to fund research into these ideas.

For example, Canadian health care spending currently exceeds $200 billion/year yet the total CIHR budget represents ~$1 billion (ie. <0.5% of total industry spending).  By comparison, the expansion fee for an NHL hockey team has increased from $80 million to $500 million over a 15 year period.  ","As an eternal optimistic, my sense is that our new Canadian federal government places more value on knowledge than our past government - which has already translated into some modest increases in federal funding.  Assuming that these increases will be sustained, I would anticipate that there will be a concomitant increase in the next generation pursuing research.  ",0,High Income

NSERC will loudly repeat that it serves as a 'grant-in-aid': in aid of what? Of CIHR, that is currently in a government-induced shambles? Industry-related grants have a greater success rate. In fact, they are generally undersubscribed...because Canadian industry can't afford to support research.  And this has been the case for over a decade. A solution to this problem would not be simple because it  would require fundamental changes to how Canada supports industry.","My students are so discouraged. While many of my trainees became professors 10-15 yrs ago, it hasn't happened in the past 8 yrs, and the Vanier scholar I am training will quit science after his doctoral studies because he just can't imagine living this life of constant struggle.",We are all hoping that the new government will overturn shocking decisions and reforms made in the past decade to bring Canada back to a level where Canadian researchers can once more stand proud and strong.,High Income

This may be part of the previous government's policy, and perhaps we'll see change with the new government. So far, however, most of the evidence of any change has been promises and some work towards restructuring granting agencies and processes. This is hopeful, but I'm waiting to see if any of the promises pan out into reality or if things end up being just the previous paradigm in a new outfit.","As I said in my previous comment, I'm taking a wait-and-see approach to the new government. So far there have been indications that things will get better, but I'll believe it when I see it.

","Funding fundamental science is critical to maintain a healthy and robust scientific community. By strangling the funding for fundamental research, grants have become highly competitive with low success rates and there is increased stress for people in academia. This is portraying a negative image for next generation of researchers. This is reflected in the decreasing number of Canadian PhD candidates (among other contributing factors).","I strongly believe that a country's research funding must have balance between applied/translation and fundamental research. Fundamental research is the backbone of translation research, and if we focus only on translation, we risk  exhausting the ""low hanging fruit"" that was made possible by past fundamental research and there will be void left by under funding fundamental investigation.",High Income

Last year, I got the same amount of funding as I did when I first started as an assistant professor, despite the tens of publications and students I graduated over the decade. The rules of NSERC discovery grants, the most basic and often the only source of funding for most researchers working on fundamental sciences, constantly change, and I feel like no matter how much I improve my proposal, I am constantly getting rankings that gave me meaguer amount of funds that I have to continually shrinking the number of students in my research group. Compared to many other countries (US, China, Europe) etc, the amount of funding devoted to fundamental research is so little that I seriously doubt the government's commitment to promote sciences.   On the other hand, I did try to divert into industrial related research (I am in geophysics, so in principle could collaborate with the hydrocarbon industry). There, I feel like the NSERC fund is only being used to boost a few so-called 'front runners' in the field who already have a lot of industrial connections and frankly a lot of support from industry already. Hence with all the different NSERC programs, they can receive astronomically amount of funds with only a small amount of industrial contribution. I think the government should support industry, but I don't think the government funds should be used to subsidise industry like this at the expense of all the other fundamental research. Needlessly to say, for an early researcher with some ideas hoping to work with industry, but no deep connections, the NSERC industry-collaborative programs success rate is also very low.   I think what should be done by NSERC is to have a stated budget for fundamental research to cover programs like the NSERC discovery grants, and if there is indeed need, special budget can be set up for industrial-collaborative (so-called Applied Research) projects.  Remember for example, in the US, the oil and gas industry are doing their own R&D, and the NSF do not have direct research program to get involved. ","Needless to say, with smaller research groups, and faculty constantly struggling for funding, graduate students will be discouraged to pursue research work in their own fields, or maybe abandon science entirely (e.g., becoming a banker).","To really reverse the damage done to the funding system over the past decade, the current government need to put in more funds into fundamental research, and completely update the funding structures.",High Income

The brain-power of the research community has been significantly reduced to a ""chosen few"" and as such important research is not being conducted overall across Canada as in the past. In addition, the vast majority of research money has been focused towards short-term industry issues effectively putting public research money into enriching the corporations (getting researchers and industry research done for pennies on the dollar...for example most Mitacs grants and many NSERC grants) rather than using that money for actual research discoveries.  This is absolutely shameful and does not boad well for the future research success of this country.",The trends have gotten worse over time and I don't see the downward trend changing any time soon.,"The government and the government funding agencies in Canada need to recognize that research is not about using public research dollars for for-profit industry cheap labour.  This is a shameful use of the public purse because it is tantamount to government subsidies subvertly being directed to for-profit organizations under the guise of funding research.  In addition, picking ""winners"" and ""losers"" (institutions and individuals) in NSERC Grants (Example: Discovery Grants) does not increase the chances of important research discoveries but rather suppresses potential discoveries through researchers that are not funded.  Appropriately funding all researchers in Canada would vastly increase the research success of Canada because the more brain-power working on research problems statistically increases the chances and value of all research being undertaken.",High Income

I think Israel (the country I work in) has enjoyed the advantage of high quality of human resources engaged in research, whose reasons are mainly historical. I also believe the level of funding is not decreasing. However, the policy of insufficient investments in research-based education and educational infrastructure and increasing lean towards ""high education for everyone"", e.g., colleges with easy entry and limited or no research programs, will have a negative impact on future academic research.  2. I believe that research community may be following now a self-destructive path, making an irreversible damage to itself and future support. The current ways to evaluate research performance and outcomes, in which quantity is preferred over quality, superficial selling points and buzz words over physical insights, and wishful thinking  over reasonable doubts and criticism, is the largest risk to future research support. It is undermining the credibility and value of research in the eyes of general public and academic community itself. Unless this global trend is reversed, the price will be paid by the future generations.    ",High Income

Unless there is an overall decrease in funding, the next generation will pursue careers in successful research areas. ","I find the definition of 'applied research' somewhat narrow. In my opinion, applied research is not just about the use of existing knowledge to develop practical solutions. It is not uncommon to see new 'fundamental' knowledge emerging from applied research or use-inspired research... Also, when it comes to grant applications, there are opportunities to combine all three research types (e.g. fundamental, use-inspired, and applied); so it was difficult for me to complete this survey as most of my research projects combine all three types of research. For some of us, research is the pursuit of knowledge to understand natural phenomena and processes, which can also be useful to address societal issues or to develop practical solutions to specific challenges... Quite a blend isn't it!? I would end this comment by adding that even the for-profit sector (at least in my field) is willing to support a certain level of fundamental research... of course they presumably do it only if they see it can potentially generate new 'useful' knowledge in the long run. Anyways, good luck sorting out all the results and interpreting them!   ",High Income

The number of programs for applied has increased, but so has the number of applicants that have moved over ","For careers, the total funding is more important than the allocation between categories. Applied research attracts somewhat different people to research. If there's more money available for applied research, then you'll have more people working in applied research. If there's less money available for fundamental research, you will have fewer people working there. But if the total expenditure remains the same, it's likely that the same number of careers will be generated, although it might select for different individuals depending on how that funding is distributed across categories.","One benefit I have seen in the move towards applied research, and partnership with industry, is in the level of research productivity. Researchers involved in those sorts of partnerships tend to develop a very strong work ethic, and work in a fast-paced manner in order to satisfy crystallized project deliverables for external stakeholders. Productivity is not typically measured, however, and publications. But, it's my belief that applied research also feeds back to fundamental research because of the cultural productivity shift. Studies in this country show that the most successful researchers in pure science are the most successful across categories, indicating a buffered economy, and an ability to move skills from one arena to the other. Certainly a balance of everything is important, and going to far down any path is a bad idea. ",High Income

There are in other words many more positions available for applied research than for fundamental research.,"The perception I have of the Canadian federal government view of research is that its main purpose is to train students for high tech jobs. I am not convinced that there is much ambition to actually encourage (i.e. fund) high quality research, except perhaps at 3 or 4 universities across the country. The way the NRC (National Research Council) was treated by the government was also shockingly bad...they turned it into an organization whose main role was to do research for industry. Rather than constantly giving away taxpayer's money in handouts to industry the government should be looking for ways to encourage industry to set up their own research groups.",High Income

Some feedback.    1.  I did not find myself on your list (senior scientist at an NGO / Institute is not listed). I put academic, because i have academic appointments, but I am not an academic. 2. I think in part three, under the ""importance of stakeholders"", the word mandatory is problematic.  The answer will be ""sometimes"", because we all submit more than one grant, and some of them will require this... 3. there is no write in under ""field of research"" = other.

My answers about current work refer to my current position in the USA. Had I accepted post doctoral work in Canada, my funding would have likely been from the private sector, and I would have viewed this as a negative change. Over the course of 15 months in 2013-2015, 5 PhD candidates (myself included) graduated from the lab of my PhD advisor (a very highly regarded Canadian researcher in ecology (fundamental research)). Although we all wanted to work in Canada, all of us left for post doc positions abroad because the Canadian funding climate had shifted so dramatically away from fundamental research and towards applied research / industrial partnerships. To date, only one of us has returned, and she accepted underemployment to do so. I have heard similar stories from many other early career researchers (ECRs) in the last 10 years. I am curious to know whether Canada has become, once again, a net exporter of (ecology / env't science) ECRs. Once ECRs leave the country it can be very difficult to get them back. I strongly believe that fundamental science makes important contributions to society, via its eventual applications to practical problems facing society - following this logic, this ECR diaspora can ultimately mean that the long-term societal contributions are lost from a generation of scientists.

However Universities are very poorly funded. There are no regular sources of funds for institutional research. Grants can be applied for through the Ministry of S & T and education but the amount of funds are meagre, e.g. most commonly ~$2000 per year. In 1% cases, these may go up to $10,000 per year, but the criteria for selection are not well-documented. On the other hand, the students with the best merit usually study at Universities. Priority-wise the subjects chosen Science are for engineering, medicine, computer science, genetic engineering, pharmacy, microbiology, biochemistry & molecular biology, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, soil science. One of the least priorities is agriculture. So although the funding is highest in Agricultural Research, the best of students choose to study in general universities and not agricultural ones.

The policy and the priorities as outlined in the objectives of the respective ministries of the Government advocate for its acceptance.  ,"The scope of research is broadening, hence is the funding. However, the amount of grants, as offered by the Government is below par. One of the hindrances is the outcome of the grant is not monitored or evaluated rigorously to promote further funding. Overall, the existing funding system to different researchers is mostly quantitative, rather than qualitative. Had the funding is made conditional to a researcher in order to be eligible for further funding, the investment could have been more rewarding. Further, it is still a huge challenge to attract non-government bodies, such as industries to invest on R&D. Bangladesh needs to find a way out to involve this sector to promote industry-academia linkage, and thereby, translate the outputs to touch lives through industrial scale up.","Early-career researchers who return their home countries after being graduated with phd from overseas, need ample attention to develop their career as a researcher from the respective institutions, government and NGOs. Offering seed funds to successful proposals will make them inclined to deliver their best. To be eligible for these awards, they need to be trained from local authorities, that will meet the local needs. Upon successful demonstration of their outputs, their endeavor needs to be further inspired by proper funding. The ability to build up a research cohort across and beyond the country will be considered as their added eligibility. Likewise, a national directory will be created where the successful researcher will be identified as experts and thereby will gain attention to become further funded from other potential sources. Definitely, this will have an implication to reverse brain-drain, and achieve brain-gain from the networks.",High Income

I wonder if in the current climate Paul Nurse would have been funded to study cell cycle in yeast before anybody knew how conserved the process was and thus began to have major translational implications.

The only way around is do a double stream of research, where you combine fundamental and applied research, the latter to get the funding, which then to a minor extend also feeds the fundamental research.  Any fundamental idea/proposal is shot at from so many angles, even if it is a must that we need to do something in that area, and that partially also because people feel threatened in what they are doing if something new comes around. It is a hard battle, and has in now way gotten easier. ","The survey asks some right questions, but does not allow to put a perspective to things. For example, which is the size of the research grant, a 5k versus a 5 m are quite different stories.  I was away from academia for a while after graduating my PhD, but for each grant proposal I submit, when I get the feedback, I can tell that people do not appreciate new ideas, as they break with what they have been doing for years and threaten their career. This is not how research should be dealt with, so I actually question the whole review process. Having worked as a patent examiner, the granting process is a two way communication, in research, most is still a one way process, grant applications, paper submissions, they are all one way, the originator cannot provide feedback on what the reviewer said, giving the reviewer too much power as they do not have to defend their point, just state it. Even if it is brutally wrong, they still get away with it, which is not right, in many ways. ",High Income

Even an increase in funding availability will only slightly reverse that trend in the short term as those increases will only allow the levels of funding to recover to the amount received by the previous generation. The message to most trainees is that research funding is almost impossible to get and you will spend your whole career fighting to get funding.

Peter Higgs recently said that he wouldn't survive in today's climate and it is very doubtful that he would have been funded for his research at all today.,Most of my colleagues pursue a career in research for the love of the work rather than the money. Whether as many can sustain a career is a different matter.  I suspect that the competition will get stiffer and numbers leaving academia and research will grow.,0,High Income

But we'll see.,"I am very disappointed in the changes to research funding in Canada that have devalued fundamental research and emphasized only industrial and direct clinical applications.  In my view, this often forces researchers to put a spin on their work towards these applications.  In many cases, the spin not genuine and therefore wastes precious research funding that could be better spent on basic science.    My field (neuroscience) is so new that even though there are many real applications, there is also so much potential for basic research to understand the human brain in ways that will provide the foundations for future applications.  Science is full of so many examples of curiosity-driven research that eventually led to powerful applications.  If only the politicians better understood this.",High Income

Research that can help someone make money. I am talking about research funded by the government for academics. That sector needs to be pure blue sky because that is the only way that knowledge can be generated that will support the efforts of the industrial sector to make money. Things should not be confused. The academy is supposed to make knowledge. It is a bad thing when the academy needs to make money. Those are different goals. A great example is Bell labs -- when its owners gave the scientists free reign to do anything, they did, and profits came later. When that freedom was choked off in the name of 'use' then there went the profits. ",Personal motiviation is complex. People love doing science. They will find a way.

It is not ideal if they are all governed by the same forces.  Universities are uniquely positioned to deliver fundamental research. This capability should not be diminished. Government institutions such as the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific Research Organization) in Australia are better suited to deliver applied research. This capacity should also be maintained. Fundamental knowledge is not static, it is continually being created through fundamental research. Many applied problems, both current and future,  will require fundamental knowledge that is at present unknown. It is the task of Governments to direct public funding. This in itself is an applied research problem. The question of what factors Governments should consider and how they should consider them is a question for user inspired research. The ability to find appropriate solutions to these research problems may be beyond us with our current fundamental knowledge base. ",High Income

I believe forcing such partnerships without regard as to the nature and topic of research will have severe negative effects on the quality of research as well as our ability as a society to progress. Research in Australia (at least across my peers and their Universities) seems to strive to become a business venture that is being marketed under the umbrella of education and generating knowledge. The latter two, are, however and sadly, no longer the focus. This problem extends to teaching, where courses are increasingly targeted to ""paying"" customers, rather than the priorities to achieve sound education and critical thinking across the population.

The key thing is that funders and scientists cannot accurately predict the source of the next major advance e.g. CRISPR/Cas 15 years ago.  They must invest broadly and then wait for the innovations to percolate up. If they are truly transformational they will become applied quite naturally and rapidly.  But without the broad investment in fundamental science the innovations will be delayed in arriving.,High Income

The competition in that fund (with success rate 8%) increased, and the panels changed in ways that also made it harder for me. I luckily had a large grant won in 2008 that then supplied 3 years funding starting the following year. Since staring to apply again in 2013 I have been unsuccessful. Zero research funds.

I very strongly believe in the value of fundamental research and support increased and broader funding of such research.    In mathematics obtaining funding for fundamental research has always been challenging and has only become more so.  The uses for such funding (including time away from other duties to be able to focus, travel for talks and collaboration, better access to published articles and books, sometimes computing tools) are somewhat harder to quantify and defend by comparison to those who need expensive equipment to conduct research.  There is also a tradition of larger awards to a few elite researchers rather than a broader array of smaller awards to more researchers at a wider variety of institutions, even though quality fundamental research *is* often being done at such institutions.  Prioritizing research with a shorter-term tangible economic outcome fails to appreciate the potential long-term importance and inherent worth of fundamental research.",High Income

With no retirement age in Australia, opportunities for the next generation are likely to remain similar or worse than at present.","I have by choice evolved my work from 100% fundamental at beginning of my career to close to 100% applied at present and I have benefited enormously from the emphasis given to collaborative R&D and willingness of industry and NGOs to support my R&D and willingness of governments to co-fund work with industry. However, I am deeply concerned about the lack of emphasis placed on fundamental research by the funding agencies in Australia (and many other countries) plus the major shift of our national R&D agency, CSIRO, from being a flagship of long-term fundamental and strategic research to its current focus on industry-driven and co-funded research.

How was DNA discovered?  Did scientists at that time have an applied outcome in mind for this discovery?  Unlikely.  Has it contributed enormously to the swath of medical breakthroughs leading to the current good health (and crime-solving, if you want to bring forensics into it) that society enjoys today?  Yes.  One doesn't need to be a scientist to figure this one out, one just needs to be prepared to invest in long term benefits of science.

In these countries, applied research is irrelevant to development since the economy is governed by international companies that have their bases of research in the developed countries and are not interested in investing in research in the peripheral countries. On the other hand, since nationally-based economies and enterprises are underdeveloped, there is a shift in industrial and agricultural production which becomes more and more oriented to commodities production which requires less and less human work since it can be substituted by artificial agents. Therefore employment in the developing countries shifts towards management and logistics. That determines a plummet collapse of country's culture in particular scientific culture.

This has meant a change from very low levels of funding that was additionally unpredictable in dates and rules to a modest but at least level of funding that is at least predictable. This has been accompanied by a strong emphasis on applied research. Our research community is generally not mature for really good applied research. This has led many researchers to disguise their basic research projects into applied ones in order the obtain funding. Hence considerable funds have been allocated to researchers that would otherwise not be competitive, via such ""disguised"" projects. The priority given by government to applied research applies also to posgraduate student scholarships and to so-called ""initiation"" research grants (aimed at PhD students). This last aspect is particularly undesirable, because it deviates students away from obtaining their initial training in the context of good science, into possibly not-so-good ""applied"" science. ","There is a strong trend at the moment for a decrease in undergraduante enrolment in careers perceived to have research as their only (or main) area of employment. This of course impact on the number of young people undertaking careers in science.   The trend just mentioned does not necessarily follow recent trends in research funding (as funding overall has increased over the last 10 years). It instead reflects a cultural change, from idealism (I'll study what I like best) to realism (I'll study what will secure me a good living in material terms). More specifically, the trends reflects the disillusionment of the younger generations with the harsh career bottleneck that prevents many PhD graduates from securing tenure in academia, combined with the lack of (satisfactory) jobs for PhD graduates outside academia.   In short, the modest increase in science funding has not been enough to counter the decrease in number of students.

So, it is vital for the funding agencies to fund projects that are of timely importance and of economic value to fuel back to the society to elevate and improve of standards of living. Thus, problems and projects of timely importance with theoretic and practical values are highly valued since it is immediately impacting lives of people. However, when the nation become developed, say like the U.S, you need to go beyond the frontiers of present day knowledge towards understanding of the universe around us. Basic problems in quantum studies, replicating energy efficiency and synthesis in plants towards our energy needs or even life exploration beyond earth and 'lifetronics' are possibly some of many themes for tomorrow's research.   Earth is still a point mass in this universe. There are plenty of basic problems to be explored to make life better and for our own understanding of the 'self', and processes, phenomena and networks of 'nature'. Necessity is the mother of all inventions and discovery. After all, we are living beings, dwelling on one planet today, though divided by geography.","As I mentioned earlier, not many can carry out basic/fundamental work. It requires special skills, innate talent, intuition and hard work within a multidisciplinary thrust, all in one package. One cannot pump in money to every researcher as fundamental. It is on successful delivery after a fixed but long time period, one can see its impact. However, one must note that fundamental work can lead to new fields and technology impact. It must be supported. India is pushing this. Technological impact can eventually lead to solutions to make our lives better. Some researchers do basic work, some applied, some a mixture of both. Eventually, one needs to have a portfolio of both basic and applied research through grants to see research missions/programs successful and fuel a new generation of students to carry the torch forward globally across. In short, I see that fundamental research will pace up in next few years considerably since applied work can be partnered with industry for profits.   ","India has been steadily pushing on academic investments, attracting global faculty, which is good. Hiring of academicians who have multidisciplinary interests with strong research, teaching and service components, with possibly entrepreneurship skills and success stories are very valuable in today's age than hire just based on possible prospects to beget funding in an area of immediate interest for a university in any country. Talented people are global assets and these individuals bring change to the world, like Bohr, Curie, Fleming or Nash and Ramanujan.",Lower Middle Income

Most times basic scientists address the general public, they (we) emphasise the most applied sides and possibilities of our own research - to the extreme of disguising our basic research so as to make it appear as being applied research. We have failed to explain that basic research benefits society (not just in terms of ""culture"" but in practical, economic terms) in indirect and non-intuitive ways. My intuition is that these ways must revolve mostly around the build-up (in each society) of a wide base of people capable of thinking scientifically, as well as capabilities in terms of scientific techniques. This build-up in the long term leads to good-quality applied research, and also to the improvement of non-science-related aspects of society through the spill-over of scientifically minded people to various activitiies. Another way in basic research often gives economic benefits are serendipitous discoveries with practical applications. ",Higher Middle Income

In order to win grants, scientists must wildly over-promise on what they can reasonably deliver, so that every second grant promises a breakthrough cure for cancer.   There is also a deep failure in understanding how science actually works. The system operates as a relay, so that a huge amount of fundamental research is eventually packaged into an applied form.  If a piece of research is truly ""innovative"" and ""novel"" (buzzwords favoured by Australian funding bodies), it is actually impossible to predict the future practical applications in technology. The people working on bacterial immunity(!) could not possibly have predicted that their work would have eventuated in CRISPRs that could be used to edit the genomes of virtually any organism.   If we continually cut the legs out from fundamental research, the ""applied researchers"" so currently beloved by funding bodies, will soon find that they have nothing to work with. ",High Income

Medical research attracts most public and not-for profit funding. ",0,"Right now, I can see the next generation of scientists, and in particular female scientists, leaving research en masse. This is because they are deterred by the job insecurity, high workload, lack of funding and career opportunities. This is particularly true for mid-career researchers who simply run out of funding -- given that public funding focuses largely on early career or established scientists. And overseas applicants are more competitive for ARC funding due to overall better infrastructure.",High Income

In the modern Science it is often becoming difficult to separate the two. Hence unless both of these types of research are encouraged they will both suffer skewness and stop evolving and will taken over by religious dogmas as it is unfortunately happening in India. I would like that at least the Academicians stop differentiating themselves between Pure and Applied which has unfortunately become the trend. In India the support by private industry for research is very poor hence there is no danger of skewness between the two types arising. But the research community is too small and the influential end up grabbing the major part of the cake. That is why India has large class highest national awardees in Sciences who have not done important Science. ,Lower Middle Income
